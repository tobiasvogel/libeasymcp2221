# libeasymcp2221
A C implementation of the [EasyMCP2221](https://github.com/electronicayciencia/EasyMCP2221)-Python module, with the goal of a "conceptual 1:1" port from Python to C, but the APIs are not structurally identical (Python is class-based and exception-driven; this C library is function-based and error-code-driven).
